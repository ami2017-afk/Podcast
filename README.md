# Podcast

The project is focused on building a web application for managing and playing podcasts using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The frontend of the application will be designed using HTML and CSS to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. JavaScript will be used to implement various interactive features and functionalities such as audio playback, search, and sorting.

The backend of the application will be built using PHP to handle data retrieval and storage from API. The PHP backend will also provide the necessary server-side functionality to authenticate users, fetch data, and perform data processing tasks.

The application will have various features such as the ability to search and browse podcasts, filter by genre, save favorite podcasts, create playlists, and share podcasts on social media platforms. Users will be able to create accounts to personalize their experience and receive recommendations based on their listening habits
